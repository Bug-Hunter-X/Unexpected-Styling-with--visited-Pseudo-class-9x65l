# Unexpected Styling with :visited Pseudo-class

This repository demonstrates a common CSS bug involving the misuse of the `:visited` pseudo-class. The `:visited` pseudo-class is intended to style links that have been visited by the user, but it's often used incorrectly, leading to unexpected styling changes or rendering issues.

The `bug.css` file shows the incorrect usage, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version. 

**Key Issue:** Applying :visited to non-link elements or using it incorrectly for link styling.
